## Definetly Not Malware - a Ransomware Sample
*Test Project*

Just having fun and learning basic encryption and ransomware attacks.
Runs through important directories such as Desktop, Downloads, Videos, Pictures, and Documents and encrypts all the file data using RSA encryption. 
The program will then give you the Private key and a Decryption script in a file on the desktop so you can recover data.

## * FUTURE PLANS *
 - Antimalware Detection
   - Try to bypass
 - Obscure File Types after Encryption
 - Data Collection Tools
   - Get Cookie Data
   - Get Passwords
   - Automatically look for "important" files
   - Key Logger (Not sure if it's useful on "ransomware")
 - Remote Access Tool (Not sure if it's useful on "ransomware")

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY - DON'T BE STUPID WHEN USING
